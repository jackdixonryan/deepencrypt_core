While we work on game design, we need to bear in mind some of the things that make grindable games fun. Our grindables will work - and frankly, that's not the challenge. I can create resources that can be depleted. I can create inventories. I can create wallets. This is not the challenge. The challenge is how to bake a story into the game. 

First off, we need characters to tell a story. Because of Deepencrypt's nature, I think it would be awesome to use something like G-chat-looking DM windows, which the player can either initiate or which appear at various places in the web structure.

It's going to be incredibly hard to interpret text inputs with something like a chatbot - in fact, I don't feel like even doing it. So I think that the trick will be to create Divinity2-esque dialogues with characters. These dialogues can be influenced by a context of variables, and by how the player interacts with the chat. 

Let's overengineer the hell out of this problem!
